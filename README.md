This is my university final year dissertation, a self-defined project, where I designed and created a purely mechanical prototype of an upper-limb prosthetic for bicycle repair. 
I decided to pursue a prosthetic limb due to their complexity and the dissatisfaction for products already on the market. 
In conclusion, I produced and refined several prototypes, each increasing in complexity and practicality.
